# Algorithm Visualizer (C++)

A **data structures and algorithms visualizer** written in C++, designed to be clean, modular, and powerful â€” ideal for learning, teaching, and experimenting with fundamental and advanced algorithms, especially those used in **quantitative analysis** and technical interviews.

> Built from scratch using C++ and a minimal graphics engine (SFML support planned).

## Features:

- Simple GUI interface to visualize steps of:
  - Sorting algorithms (e.g., Merge, Quick, Heap)
  - Searching algorithms (Binary, Linear)
  - Graph algorithms (Dijkstra, DFS, BFS, Kruskal)
  - Tree traversals (In-Order, Pre-Order, Post-Order)
  - Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, LCS, etc.)
- Modular file structure with reusable templated node definitions
- Visual tests and live animations in development
- Focus on **quant-relevant data structures**:
  - Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees
  - Hash Maps, Graphs
  - AVL and Red-Black Trees
